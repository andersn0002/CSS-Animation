## Exercises Chapter 1: The Basics

Now that we know how we can target different elements it's time to write some CSS. Open up your favorite (online) editor and use the HTML markup to complete the exercises.

### Lengths

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div class="parent">My font size should be 12px</div>
      <div class="first">I should have a hardcoded height of 20px</div>
      <div class="second">I should have the height of the screen</div>
      <div class="third">My font should be twice as big as my parents font even when it changes</div>
      <div class="fourth">My font should be three times as big as the default font size of this document</div>
      <div class="fifth">I should be half the width of my parent</div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Typography

Use the [google fonts API](https://www.google.com/fonts) to give the element below a nice font.

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hey sexy!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Selectors

```html
<html>
  <body class="green content">
    <div>
      <span>My text should be green</span>
      <span>My text shoudln't be green</span>
      <div class="name">
        Your name is:
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="green">
      I should have a green background
      <span>My text should be red</span>
      <div>
        <div>I could be brown</div>
        <div>I could be blue</div>
        <div>I could be violet sky</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```
