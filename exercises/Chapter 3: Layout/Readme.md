# Exercises Chapter 3: Layout

With what we have learned, let's create the following "layout".

Create a block that looks something like this:

![Exercise 3.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjrio/mjr-css/master/assets/exercises3-1.png)

Now create a wrapper that contains 3 of your blocks, just like the example:

![Exercise 3.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjrio/mjr-css/master/assets/exercises3-1.png)

There are a few limitations, otherwise this would be easy.

```css
/* This is the parent container */
section {
  background: grey; /* or whatever you want */
  width: 940px;
}
```

Now do the same but only use tables.
